Today I'm launching my learning journal. The goal is simple: document what I learn each day to stay accountable and track my progress.

## What I Worked On

- Set up this blog using Jekyll and GitHub Pages
- Configured the dark theme and layout
- Added a skills section to showcase my technical focus areas

## Key Takeaways

Building in public is a great way to stay motivated. Even small daily progress adds up over time.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow I'll dive deeper into a specific topic and document my findings here.
