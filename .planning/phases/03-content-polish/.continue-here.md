<current_state>
v1.0 Visual Refresh milestone is essentially complete. All 3 phases (6 plans) are shipped and verified. The milestone completion ceremony (/gsd:complete-milestone) ran almost to the end — all archival, PROJECT.md evolution, ROADMAP.md reorganization, STATE.md updates, and the milestone commit are done. The only remaining step is creating the git tag `v1.0`.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 1: Color Foundation (2/2 plans) — shipped
- Phase 2: Typography & Layout (2/2 plans) — shipped
- Phase 3: Content Polish (2/2 plans) — shipped
- Phase 3 verification: human-approved (syntax highlighting + anchor headings)
- Milestone archival: MILESTONES.md created with accomplishments
- PROJECT.md: full evolution review — "What This Is" updated, all 16 requirements moved to Validated, Key Decisions table updated with outcomes, Context section updated
- ROADMAP.md: reorganized with milestone grouping (collapsed details block)
- STATE.md: updated to reflect milestone complete
- REQUIREMENTS.md: deleted (archived to milestones/v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md)
- Milestone commit: `6c3494d chore: complete v1.0 milestone`
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Git tag v1.0: User declined the tag creation — may want to skip it, modify the message, or create it manually later
- Optional: push tag to remote
- Optional: `/gsd:new-milestone` to start v2.0 planning
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Skipped milestone audit (user chose to proceed without formal audit)
- Skipped phase directory archival (user chose "Skip" — phases stay in .planning/phases/)
- All 16 v1 requirements marked as validated in PROJECT.md
- v2 deferred items (Inter font, TOC, tag pills, progress bar, print stylesheet) listed in Out of Scope
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None — user declined git tag, but that's optional
</blockers>

<context>
The blog visual refresh is fully shipped. Everything from color foundation through syntax highlighting and anchor headings is live. The .planning/ directory is clean: ROADMAP.md is collapsed to a one-line milestone summary, PROJECT.md reflects the shipped state, and archived copies of the roadmap and requirements are in .planning/milestones/.

Phase directories remain in .planning/phases/ (user chose not to archive them).
</context>

<next_action>
If resuming: optionally create git tag v1.0 (or skip), then run `/gsd:new-milestone` if starting v2.0 work. Or just start writing blog posts — the site is ready.
