## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 3-phase structure (Color Foundation, Typography & Layout, Content Polish)
- Roadmap: Technical cleanup (TCH-01, TCH-02) bundled into Phase 1 as preconditions for clean color work
- 01-01: Used body a prefix for link specificity (0,0,1,1) instead of !important
- 01-01: Mapped tagline color to --text-muted (existing variable) rather than creating new variable
- 01-02: Adopted Discord-inspired neutral grey palette (#1e1f22 base) over alternative dark themes
- 01-02: Purple accent (#9b84ec) replaces pink (#ff7edb) -- confirmed via visual testing
- 01-02: Muted text (#949ba4) at 5.87:1 contrast, comfortably above WCAG AA minimum

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None -- Phase 1 blockers resolved:
- ~~Phase 1: Exact purple accent color needs visual testing~~ -- #9b84ec confirmed via visual verification
- ~~Phase 1: Disabling Minima dark skin may surface unstyled elements~~ -- build audit passed, no leakage
- ~~Phase 1: Muted text contrast on grey surfaces may be borderline~~ -- 5.87:1 ratio confirmed adequate
