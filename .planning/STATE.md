## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 3-phase structure (Color Foundation, Typography & Layout, Content Polish)
- Roadmap: Technical cleanup (TCH-01, TCH-02) bundled into Phase 1 as preconditions for clean color work
- 01-01: Used body a prefix for link specificity (0,0,1,1) instead of !important
- 01-01: Mapped tagline color to --text-muted (existing variable) rather than creating new variable

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Exact purple accent color needs visual testing (#9b84ec vs #9b7bff vs #b5a3ff)
- Phase 1: Disabling Minima dark skin may surface unstyled elements -- static analysis passed, build audit pending (no Ruby in env)
- Phase 1: Muted text contrast on grey surfaces may be borderline (4.4:1) -- verify empirically
