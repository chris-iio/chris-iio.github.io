# Chris Infante's Blog

## What This Is

A personal blog and portfolio site for Chris Infante, built with Jekyll and deployed to GitHub Pages. Dark-themed, single-column layout with a terminal-inspired aesthetic. The site exists to share writing and establish a professional presence.

## Core Value

A clean, readable blog where Chris can publish posts without friction.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Jekyll static site with blog post support — existing
- ✓ Dark theme with custom styling — existing
- ✓ Single-column centered layout — existing
- ✓ About page with skills and certifications — existing
- ✓ GitHub Pages deployment — existing
- ✓ JetBrains Mono typography — existing
- ✓ Post cards on homepage — existing

### Active

- [ ] Refresh color scheme: dark grey background (~Discord #36393f), whites/greys for text, purple accent preserved
- [ ] Tighten centered layout inspired by steipete.me — generous whitespace, clean visual hierarchy
- [ ] Ongoing blog post writing

### Out of Scope

- Comments system — unnecessary complexity for a personal blog
- Search functionality — not enough content to warrant it yet
- RSS feed — can add later if needed
- Mobile app — static site works on mobile already
- CMS or admin panel — Markdown + git is the workflow

## Context

- Built with Jekyll, uses Bundler for dependency management
- Current theme: dark purple (#262335 background, #ff7edb pink/purple accents)
- Reference site for layout inspiration: steipete.me (clean centered layout, generous spacing, simple nav)
- Target color direction: Discord-style dark grey background, keep purple accent, whites/greys for text hierarchy
- Content flow: Markdown → Liquid templates → static HTML in `_site/`

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Jekyll + GitHub Pages — no migration, keep what works
- **Simplicity**: Minimal dependencies, no JavaScript frameworks
- **Maintenance**: Must stay easy to write and publish posts

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Keep Jekyll + GitHub Pages | Already working, familiar, zero hosting cost | — Pending |
| Discord-style dark grey over current purple bg | Easier on the eyes, more modern feel | — Pending |
| steipete.me as layout reference | Clean, centered, readable — matches the vibe | — Pending |
