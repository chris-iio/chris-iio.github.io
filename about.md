# About Me

I'm Chris, a cybersecurity professional focused on continuous learning and staying current with emerging threats and technologies.

## What I'm Working On

This site is my learning journal where I document what I'm studying, building, and exploring each day. I believe in learning in public - it keeps me accountable and might help others on a similar path.
